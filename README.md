## LP2A Project

This project is a Skyjo's inspired game for LP2A.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `resource`: the folder to maintain configuration files

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
